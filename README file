Summary of the DriverPass Project: DriverPass was the client for both Project One and Project Two. The company needed a comprehensive system to facilitate their operations, including online driving classes, practice tests, in-person lessons, and an online scheduling system. The goal was to enable customers, staff, and administrators to manage driving lessons seamlessly. DriverPass sought solutions that allowed tracking progress, managing reservations, and handling multiple user roles securely across mobile and desktop platforms. 

What I Did Well: Throughout both projects, I excelled in identifying functional and nonfunctional requirements. The detailed analysis of various user roles, such as customers, secretaries, and drivers, ensured that each userâ€™s needs were integrated into the system design. The use of clear objectives and measurable tasks in the business requirements document and Gantt Chart laid a solid foundation for the subsequent design phase. 

Potential Revisions: If I could revise one part of my work, it would be to improve upon the nonfunctional requirements section. I would add more detail on how to optimize for future growth, such as specifying tools for automated performance monitoring and scaling solutions. I feel this would ensure that the system can handle increasing user demand over time. 

Interpretation and Implementation of User Needs: Understanding user needs was central to my design approach. For example, I designed the Case Chart and Sequence Chart for the lesson scheduling system to allow customers to manage lessons online, while also considering the secretaries' need to manage in-person reservations. Role-based access control ensured secure management of user roles. This user-centered design is crucial because it ensures the system aligns with real-world workflows, improving both usability and adoption rates. 

Approach to Software Design and Future Strategies: When designing software, I focus on thorough requirements gathering, followed by iterative development with a gathering of feedback to ensure the requirements align with the goals and user expectations. In the future, I would further refine techniques like agile development process and incorporate tools like UML diagrams more often from the start to better visualize system components. Using these strategies will enable me to deliver more adaptive and scalable systems that meet evolving user needs.
